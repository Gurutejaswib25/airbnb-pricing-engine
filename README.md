# 🏠 Airbnb Dynamic Pricing Recommendation Engine

## 📌 Objective
This project builds a pricing recommendation engine for Airbnb listings using historical listing data. The goal is to help Airbnb hosts set optimal prices based on data such as location, room type, reviews, and availability.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Google Colab)** – Data Cleaning, EDA, Modeling
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn** – Data Processing & Linear Regression
- **Tableau** – Dashboard and Visualizations
- **Excel** – Initial data exploration (optional)

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Size: ~100,000 listings
- Key columns: `price`, `room_type`, `neighbourhood_group`, `availability_365`, `number_of_reviews`

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing (Python)
- Removed nulls, duplicates, and irrelevant columns
- Handled outliers in price using IQR filtering
- Encoded categorical variables
- Converted string-formatted prices to numeric
- Exported cleaned dataset to CSV

## 🧠 Key Insights
- **Manhattan** listings are the most expensive.
- **Hotel rooms** have the highest average price.
- **Private rooms** with many reviews are priced lower but get booked more.
- Listings with **higher availability** tend to have more competitive pricing.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Hosts in premium areas (like Manhattan) can maintain higher prices.
- Listings in low-review areas should reduce pricing to improve occupancy.
- Entire homes with strong reviews can raise prices slightly.
- Dynamic pricing should consider availability, seasonality, and reviews.

## 📄 Deliverables
- ✔️ `cleaned_airbnb_data.csv`
- ✔️ Python `.py` script with data cleaning and regression model
- ✔️ Tableau dashboard (public or image)
- ✔️ Final PDF report with cover page, visuals, and recommendations
